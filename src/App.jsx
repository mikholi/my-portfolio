                My studies in Oulu University of Applied Sciences began in autumn 2023. In the first year we learned basics of Python, SQL, HTML and CSS. 
                HTML was familiar to me from before, I did my first website when I was 12 years old, or something like that. First year was quite tough, there were many
                new things to learn which I never had heard of before. We also had our first project, which was quite interesting.
                But in the end, I learned a lot from the first year and it felt the right choice to change worklife to studylife.

                Right now we are nearing the end of the second year. So far this year has been lots of work. Fun too. 
                We've studied React and React Native which were both new to me and they have been very interesting. I know the basics
                from both of them, but still need a lot of practise to fully understand the code. This year I have learned alot 
                about working in the team and using version control in Github between other members. I already 
                planned making my own projects with both of them when I have time. Now the school takes most of my time. Hopefully in the
                summer I have some spare time even though  I have a summer job.
              </p>
              <h2>Where I am going?</h2>
              <p>
                Right now I am still  thinking about the future, what I might to do after I graduate. I'm still think that web design and development
                is something what I would love to do most. Still I have to keep my mind open for other options too. I'm looking forward for next year,
                when we will have more projects and internships. I hope that I will find a job that I will like.
